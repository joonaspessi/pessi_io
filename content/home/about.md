I'm currently working as a cloud architect at **Cargotec**. My day-to-day work consists of
guiding and leading a development team, working as a technical product owner, and doing hands-on development. I consider myself a staff engineer. Staff engineer that is highly enthusiastic about software quality while keeping the projects delivering actual domain value.

For the past 4-years, I have been focusing only **AWS** development. I have strong experience in building real-world **IoT data pipelines** in multiple industrial companies in Finland.

I'm an enthusiast **XC mountain biker** and endurance sports lover. During my free time, I enjoy making myself or my bike faster.

### Expertise highlights

- General **AWS** knowledge and solutions architecture
- Capable of **leading teams** and working in customer interface
- Most confident with **Python** and **Typescript**
- NoSQL and especially **DynamoDB** single table design
- **Serverless** technology stack in AWS. In my opinion, this will be the future
- Real-world industrial **Internet of things** from device connectivity to data pipelines.
